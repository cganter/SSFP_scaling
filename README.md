As discussed in (link follows), steady-state free precession SSFP sequences
exhibit a universal approximate scaling law with respect to B1+ variations
at low to moderate flip angles.

The Julia code in this repository can be used to reproduce the results from the
mentioned article and the related supplementary information.
